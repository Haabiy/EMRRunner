## Overview

The EMR Job Runner provides a RESTful API to start and monitor jobs on EMR clusters. It enables users to submit job configurations and automatically adds them to the specified EMR cluster for execution. Additionally, users can check the status of individual job steps and monitor the overall cluster status through the provided endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before using the EMR Job Runner, ensure you have the following:

- AWS IAM credentials with permissions to access EMR resources.
- An existing EMR cluster set up on your AWS account.
- Python installed on your local machine or server.
- [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html) - installed (`pip install boto3`).
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/installation/) - installed (`pip install Flask`).
- [dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - installed (`pip install python-dotenv`).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or server : https://github.com/Haabiy/EMRRunner.git
2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root directory. Include the following variables:

   ```
   
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
   
   EMR_CLUSTER_ID='YOUR_EMR_CLUSTER_ID'
   API_KEY_VALUE='YOUR_API_KEY_VALUE'
   
   BUCKET_NAME='YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
   AWS_REGION='YOUR_AWS_REGION'
   S3_PATH='YOUR_S3_PATH'

   ```

   Replace `your_access_key_id`, `your_secret_access_key`, `your_aws_region`, `your_emr_cluster_id`, `your_s3_bucket_name`, `your_api_key_value`, and `your_s3_path` with your actual AWS credentials and configurations.

   NB: It's good practice to export the necessary secret keys as environment variables before running the Flask application. Use the following commands: `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_aws_access_key_id'`

5. Ensure your AWS IAM user has the necessary permissions to access EMR resources and perform the required actions.

## Usage

- Start an EMR job: Send a POST request to `/start_emr_job` with the job configuration in JSON format, including the `job_name` and `step`. Ensure to include the `apikey` header with the value of your API key.

- Check job status: Send a POST request to `/check_job_status` with the `step_id` of the job step you want to check. Include the `apikey` header with your API key.

- Check cluster status: Send a POST request to `/check_cluster_status`. Include the `apikey` header with your API key.

For instance :

```
| Key          | Value            |
|--------------|------------------|
| Content-Type | application/json |
| apikey       | api_key_value    |

```

## Spark Deploy Modes

### Client Mode

- **Default Mode**: Driver runs on the machine initiating the Spark application.
- **Use Cases**: Interactive applications, debugging, and development.
- **Example**:
- 
  ```
  spark-submit --conf spark.pyspark.python=/usr/bin/python3 Testjob.py
  ```

### Cluster Mode

- **Driver on Worker Node**: Driver program runs on a worker node within the cluster.
- **Use Cases**: Production workloads, large-scale data processing.
- **Example**:
- 
  ```
  spark-submit --deploy-mode cluster --conf spark.pyspark.python=/usr/bin/python3 --py-files job.py Testjob.py
  ```

## Deployment Mode

When specifying the deployment mode as `cluster`, ensure to include the necessary dependencies such as `job.py` or `main.py` along with your job configuration. Additionally, include the following Spark configuration to specify the python path we would like to use:

```
--conf spark.pyspark.python=/usr/bin/python3
```
If you need to specify the Python path within the created virtual environment, use the following: 
```--conf spark.pyspark.python=/home/hadoop/myenv/bin/python```, where "myenv" is the name of the virtual environment.

## Dependency Management

To manage dependencies and ensure compatibility, it's recommended to use virtual environments. This isolates dependencies and prevents compatibility issues with Amazon's pre-built packages. Include the virtual environment activation command in your job configuration to streamline dependency management.

### Bootstrap-Action

A bootstrap action is a script that runs on each node in an Amazon EMR cluster before the primary application starts. It is commonly used to set up the environment and install necessary dependencies.

Here's an example of a bootstrap action script: [bootstrap action script](https://github.com/Haabiy/EMRRunner/blob/aa341b7ecd34fd157dca688bfaf7eb0d257285cb/bootstrap.sh)


- This bootstrap action script creates and activates a virtual environment, installs required packages using pip, and lists installed packages for verification purposes. Using a virtual environment helps to avoid dependency issues and ensures consistent package installations across environments. (Needs to be configured during the creation of EMR cluster)

## Troubleshooting

- **Exporting Environment Variables**: When running the Flask application, ensure to explicitly export the `.env` file to set up the environment variables.

- **Checking Logs**: To troubleshoot issues, SSH into the primary node of your EMR cluster and view logs using the following command:

  ```
  ssh -i /path/to/your/KeyPair.pem hadoop@your_emr_master_public_dns
  yarn logs -applicationId your_application_id
  ```

Replace `/path/to/your/KeyPair.pem`, `your_emr_master_public_dns`, and `your_application_id` with your actual values.
